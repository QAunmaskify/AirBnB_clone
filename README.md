# AirBnB clone - The console

## The Overview:
It is the first part of the whole of (AirBnB clone: Web Application) project. This first step, is necessary, entails building a minified console (like a shell) to manage the underlying data structure for the whole project in a sense of data flow and communication with **HTML/CSS templating**, **database storage**, **API**, **front-end integration** etc, which are other parts of whole project.  
## The Console in Action:
It is like other **CLI Program** but limited to a specific use-case. With this **HBNB** console, we should be able to manage the objects of our project through **CRUD** operations:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place).
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database (from a storage mean).
* Update attribute of an object.
* Destroy an object.
* Do operations like counting, reading time of new entry of an object, etc.
